Given an array, find the int that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

EXAMPLE:

[1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3] ====> 2. 


============================================

Decided to use linq here because group by functionality is exactly what we needed
for a short and elegant solution.
